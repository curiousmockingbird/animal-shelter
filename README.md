# _Animal Shelter API_

#### By _**Harold Mesa**_

#### _API for a shelter of dogs and cats._

## Technologies Used

* _C#_
* _.NET Core_
* _MySQL_
* _Entity_
* _Json Web Token (JWT) for token-based authentication._

## Description

_The Animal Shelter API provides with a database of dogs and cats. It is an API that uses the Jason Web Token (JWT) technique. Data sent between two parties using JWT is digitally signed and can be easily confirmed and trusted._

_All requests are made to endpoints beginning: http://localhost:5004/api/_

_The API has three endpoints:_
* _api/users_
* _api/cats_
* _api/dogs_

_api/cats and api/dogs provides with a database of cats and dogs, respectively. You can filter the search for cats or dogs in the database based on two parameters, their name or their sex, in the following way:_
* _api/cats?name='The name of the cat you want to look for'_
* _api/cats?sex=male_
* _api/cats?sex=female_

_Though in this moment anyone with a token can have access to the information of the users of the API (which is an inconvenient situation), keep in mind that the api/users endpoint was thought to be accessed only by administrators of the API. It is something out of the scope of this project to assign user roles for the site._

_In order to access the database, you will need an generate a Jason Web token and submit it with your API requests. An Jason Web token grants limited access to a userâ€™s account. These are the steps to generate and use a JWT in the API:_

## Setup/Installation Requirements

##### _Requesting an access token:_

* _Clone this repository to your desktop_
* _Navigate to Animal_Shelter/_
* _At the Animal_Shelter folder, create a file called appsettings.json. Paste the following code and create a password in the "Key" property of the JWT field:_
 _{
  "Logging": {
    "LogLevel": {
      "Default": "Warning",
      "System": "Information",
      "Microsoft": "Information"
    }
  },
  "AllowedHosts": "*",
  "ConnectionStrings": {
    "DefaultConnection": "Server=localhost;Port=3306;database=animal_shelter;uid=root;pwd=["YOUR-MYSQL-PASSWORD"];"
  },
  "JWT": {
    "Key": "Your super secret key goes here",
    "Issuer": "https://animal_shelter.info",
    "Audience": "Animal_Shelter.com"
  }
}_

* _If you haven't yet, install the dotnet ef tool through your command line (run $ dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef --version 5.0.1)_
* _Run $ dotnet ef database update_
* _Run $ dotnet watch run to run the API. It will open the http://localhost:5004/api/users endpoint. Open this URL in POSTMAN and send request_
* _You will get an "401 Unauthorized" response.

* _To authenticate, go to http://localhost:5004/api/users/authenticate, open the Body tab in POSTMAN, input one of the three current users of the API, and their password. You should make a POST request to authenticate the user.

##### _Using your access token:_

* _You will use your token in order to access the API endpoints. In POSTMAN, go to the Authorization tab, select the "Bearer Token" option, and place your token. Now you may access any of the API endpoints.
